## Literate programming with R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple markup language for authoring reports, slide decks, websites, and more. Critically, it allows you to integrate code (`R`, `python`, `html`, etc) into the body text of your work. This combination of coding and typesetting is called "literate programming."


### Markdown resources  
There are a number of excellent, stand-alone resources on Markdown. Yihui Xie's [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), for example, covers installation, documents, slide presentations, and much more. 

<!-- This is a comment in markdown.
Does it do line breaks?
Yes it does.-->
<!-- shift + command/ctrl + c to comment -->

### Workflow  
When you're ready to start communicating findings through a report or slide presentation, try the following: 

1. Create a new `.Rmd` file and a new `.R` script in your project folder.  
1. Use the `.R` script to test out and write initial code.  
1. Outline the `.Rmd` document (all headers and sub headers).  
1. Paste the final code chunks into the `.Rmd` doc, and test them.  
7. Write the main body text.  

## Markdown structure 
Markdown documents (`.Rmd` files) have three parts:

- *YAML metadata* defining the document parameters
  - Specify author, title, date, etc
  - Set output type: HTML, PDF, MS Word, etc
- *R code chunks* to execute on `Knit`
- *Body text*

When you `Knit` your R markdown document, `knitr` and `pandoc` work together to generate a file that includes written content and the output of any code (e.g., figures and tables). 

### Code chunks 
You can embed code chunks like this:

```{r tab1}
  df %>%
    group_by(wheel) %>%
    summarise(
      Min = min(weight_tons),
      Mean = mean(weight_tons),
      Max = max(weight_tons)
    ) %>%
    kable(
      caption = 'Trash weight (tons) by wheel', 
      digits = 1L,
      format = 'latex',
      booktabs = TRUE
    )
```

Every code chunk begins and ends with the triple back tick, and you must specify that the code included in the chunk is `r` code. When you `knit`, or render, the document, `knitr` processes the code and displays the output (see Table 1 above).

You can also integrate code directly into the text. For example, the `trash_wheels` data includes records for `r nrow(df)` total bins with a maximum recorded weight of `r max(df$weight_tons)`.


### Including Plots
Plots generated from code chunks are placed directly in the document. For example:

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.asp = 0.618, fig.cap='Weights by wheel'}
  df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = wheel, y = weight_tons)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal()
```


## Hard things (at first)

### Line breaks 
Line breaks require two spaces. New paragraphs need two hard returns.
When I `knit`, this line gets sucked into the one above. If I add two spaces and return at the end of the line, then  
I become a new line all to myself. If I want a whole new paragraph, I need two hard returns.

Now I'm a new paragraph. 

### Knitting and errors
`Knit` often! Write a bit and `Knit`. Code a bit and `Knit`. Check every code chunk.
